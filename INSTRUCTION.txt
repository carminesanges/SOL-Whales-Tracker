WHALE TRACKER - INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

This script tracks large trades (whales) for any trading pair on the Binance Spot market using real-time data. By default, it is configured to track SOL/USDC.

Follow these steps to get it running on your Windows PC.


## Step 1: Install Python

You need Python installed on your computer. If you don't have it, follow these instructions:

1.  Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2.  Download the latest stable version for Windows (e.g., Python 3.11).
3.  Run the installer. **IMPORTANT:** On the first screen of the installer, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH". This is crucial for the next steps to work!


## Step 2: Set Up the Script Folder

1.  Create a new folder on your computer where you want to store the script (for example, on your Desktop, name it `crypto_tracker`).
2.  Download all the project files (`whale_tracker_solusdc.py`, `requirements.txt`, and this `INSTRUCTIONS.txt` file) and place them inside your new folder.


## Step 3: Install Required Libraries

You need to install the libraries the script depends on. You can choose one of the two methods below.

**Method A (Recommended): Using the requirements file**

1.  Open the Command Prompt inside your new folder. A quick way to do this is to click on the folder's address bar, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
2.  In the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following command, then press Enter:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    This will automatically read the `requirements.txt` file and install the correct libraries.


**Method B (Manual): Installing libraries one by one**

1.  Open the Command Prompt inside your folder.
2.  Copy and paste the following command, then press Enter:

    pip install requests websockets colorama


## Step 4: Configure the Script (Optional)

You can run the script with its default settings (tracking SOL/USDC) or customize it by editing the `whale_tracker_solusdc.py` file with a text editor (like Notepad).

* **To Change the Trading Pair:**
    Find the `SYMBOL` variable and change its value. For example, to track BTC/USDC:
    `SYMBOL = "BTCUSDC"`

* **To Enable Telegram Alerts:**
    1.  Find the "TELEGRAM CONFIG" section.
    2.  Set `TELEGRAM_ENABLED` to `True`.
    3.  Replace `"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"` with your actual Telegram Bot Token from @BotFather.
    4.  Replace `0` with your numerical Telegram Chat ID.


## Step 5: Run the Script

You're all set! To start the tracker, type the following command in the same Command Prompt window and press Enter:

    python whale_tracker_solusdc.py

The script will start running and printing live trade analysis to the console.

To stop it, just press `CTRL + C` on your keyboard.
