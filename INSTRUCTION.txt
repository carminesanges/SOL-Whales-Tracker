SOL/USDC WHALE TRACKER - INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

This script tracks large trades (whales) for the SOL/USDC pair on Binance.
Follow these steps to get it running on your Windows PC.

## Step 1: Install Python

You need Python installed on your computer. If you don't have it, follow these instructions:

1.  Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2.  Download the latest version for Windows.
3.  Run the installer. **IMPORTANT:** On the first screen of the installer, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH". This is crucial!



## Step 2: Set Up the Script

1.  Create a new folder on your computer, for example, on your Desktop, and name it `crypto_tracker`.
2.  Download the script file (`whale_tracker_solusdc.py`) and this `INSTRUCTIONS.txt` file into that new folder.
3.  **(Optional but Recommended) Configure Telegram Alerts:**
    * Open the `whale_tracker_solusdc.py` file with a text editor (like Notepad or VS Code).
    * Find the "TELEGRAM CONFIG" section.
    * Replace `"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"` with your actual Telegram Bot Token from @BotFather.
    * Replace `0` with your numerical Telegram Chat ID.
    * Set `TELEGRAM_ENABLED` to `True`.

## Step 3: Install Required Libraries

1.  Open the Command Prompt inside your new folder. A quick way to do this is to click on the folder's address bar, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
2.  In the Command Prompt window that appears, copy and paste the following command, then press Enter:

    pip install requests websockets colorama

    This will install the three libraries the script needs to work.

## Step 4: Run the Script

You're all set! To start the tracker, just type the following command in the same Command Prompt window and press Enter:

    python whale_tracker_solusdc.py

The script will start running and printing live trade analysis to the console. To stop it, just press `CTRL + C`.
