# SOL-Whales-Tracker üêã‚ö°

A command-line Python script that monitors real-time whale activity (**accumulation** and **distribution**) for any trading pair on the Binance Spot market, using WebSocket streams.

By default, it is configured for **SOL/USDC**, but it can be easily adapted for any other pair.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-Time Monitoring**: Connects directly to Binance's WebSocket stream for minimal latency.
* **Whale Detection**: Identifies accumulation and distribution patterns based on trade flow, size repetition, and a dynamic threshold.
* **Large Trade Alerts**: Instantly prints alerts for individual trades exceeding a configurable USD threshold.
* **Telegram Notifications**: Optional alerts for significant trades and status changes can be sent to a Telegram bot.
* **Highly Configurable**: Easily change the trading pair, analysis window, thresholds, and more.
